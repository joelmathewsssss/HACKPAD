Decided I want to do a hackpad, a hackpad that lets me use spotify without opening the player (i dont really need macros for anything else, drew out my idea and studied hackpad guide and made my repository. Was also in the highway call and talked with other hackclubbers about their idea.

I was in a call with friends also working on their highway projects. Wired up all my schematic. I learned to make a symbol for my OLED, and gave them all footprints. I wired it up in my PCB editor, adding text aswell, completing the PCB portion. Downloaded fusion360 to start my sketch for my case.
